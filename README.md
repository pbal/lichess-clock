When playing a game with 0 increment, it creates 2 clock dials. Each dial matches percentage of time for each player.
For a game with increment you will see a single dial split for both players. Each section representing time available to a player.

Supports if browser height is greater than 900 px.

## Mode 2 - Half Seesaw Bar
